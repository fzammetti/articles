* **ajax-using-xmlhttprequest-and-struts** - shows how to do AJAX in Struts 1 applications
  
* **cross-domain-ajax-with-pure-javascript** - written for JSMag, this article describes the JSON-P technique using no libraries
  
* **far-out-fowl-an-exercise-in-webos-game-development** - an article I wrote for the now-defunct Palm Developer Network that walks through creating a canvas-based game for webOS
  
* **reporting-for-the-web-with-datavision** - teaches how to use the DataVision open-source reporting tool that I'm the steward of from a web application
