A repository of my published articles

I've written a number of technical articles over the years, some of which are no longer available anywhere because where they were published no longer exist.  For posterity if nothing else, I'm dropping them here.

I consider these complete public domain at this point, so do what you want with them, no limitations as far as I'm concerned (so long as you don't try to claim them, or the code that goes along with them, as your own of course).
